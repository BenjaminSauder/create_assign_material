## create assign material 

A simple blender addon, which creates a material and applies it directly to your current selection.

In object mode it clears the existing materials and assigns this new material - in edit mode it applies the new material to the current face selection.

At the moment its not hooked up into any menu or hotkey - just search for "object.create_assign_material".
